# Fun Project: Clock

This project is a fun application entirely written with the help of GPT Chat under the guidance of the user, who provided task clarifications and direction.

## About the Project

The goal was to write the entire project without typing a single line of code manually. 
Every element of the application, from structure to styling and functionality, was created using GPT suggestions based on the user's requirements.

## Features

- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Uniform Digit Width**: The time is displayed with equal-width digits to avoid visual shifting.
- **Animated Starry Background**: The interface is styled with an animated background featuring blinking stars.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.

## Project Goal

The project's purpose was to showcase how GPT Chat can be used to write code and demonstrate how a simple yet functional application can be created without manually writing any lines of code.
